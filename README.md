# üí´ About Me:
üõ† I‚Äôm currently working on<br>Exploring generative AI and agentic systems to create innovative, intelligent solutions that address real-world challenges. Additionally, I‚Äôm developing a reconfigurable battery system for Smart Electric Vehicles (SEVs), which dynamically adjusts its configuration based on driving conditions. This advanced system leverages AI to optimize power distribution and prolong battery life, evaluating factors like state of charge (SoC), usage frequency, and switch status. It ensures efficient energy management by avoiding configurations with SoC below 30% and prioritizing configurations with fewer switches for higher efficiency. I also work as a Remote Data Scientist at U Tech Innovative Solutions & Consultancy, focusing on machine learning and data analysis to provide actionable insights for clients.<br><br>üë• I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on<br>Projects related to deep learning applications, generative AI, agentic systems, computer vision tasks, or innovative AI solutions, especially in fields that involve complex data analysis or medical applications.<br><br>ü§ù I‚Äôm looking for help with<br>Exploring advancements in reconfigurable battery systems for SEVs, researching new techniques in deep learning to enhance model performance, and expanding my work in generative AI and agentic systems.<br><br>üå± I‚Äôm currently learning<br>Advanced AI techniques, particularly in neural networks and optimization for machine learning models. I‚Äôm continually enhancing my skills in Python, Java, and TensorFlow to stay up-to-date with industry trends, while also diving deeper into generative AI and agentic technologies.<br><br>üí¨ Ask me about<br>Deep learning, data science projects, my experience with medical applications of AI, Java development, and my work on generative AI, agentic systems, and innovative SEV battery systems.<br><br>‚ö° Fun fact<br>I‚Äôm an AI enthusiast who loves to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible with machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and agentic systems‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through personal projects like handwritten text recognition or professional roles in data science.<br><br>AI/ML enthusiast | Passionate about real-world solutions in generative AI, agentic systems, computer vision, and Java development | Let‚Äôs connect!
